# Chip-8
Simple chip-8 emulator that can run chip 8 applications through the command line

## Prerequisites
- python 3.12 or later is preferred
- an installation of uv:
` pip install uv`
## How to Install
1. Clone repository to your local machine
2. run the following command to download all dependencies and create a virtual environment:
`uv sync`
3. if your IDE does not automatically activate the venv, run `source .venv/bin.activate` in the project directory
## Command to run a application
`python3 main.py {path of chip-8 application here} 0`
- NOTE: the 0 represents a configurable opcode for 8xy6 and 8xye. It shouldn't affect most applications but just in case
- It is considered best practice (FOR THIS PROJECT) to keep the chip-8 application in the same relative path as the project for easy access
## Example Command
`python3 main.py Invaders.ch8 0`
